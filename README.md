## 📈 Engineering Mindset
- I value clean design, documentation, and iteration
- I prefer simple, robust solutions over over-engineered ones
- I believe engineering skill is built by **finishing projects**, not just starting them

---

## - ⚡ Fun fact
- I’m training for Ironman and Comrades — consistency and iteration matter in both.
- Oh, I can also solve a Rubiks cube
